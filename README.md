# Express TypeScript Boilerplate

A basic boilerplate for building Express applications with TypeScript, including linting, testing, and other development tools.

## Features

- TypeScript support
- Express server setup
- Middleware for JSON and URL-encoded body parsing
- Custom middleware example
- ESLint configuration for TypeScript
- Jest setup for unit testing

## Setup

1. Install dependencies: `bun install` (or `yarn install`)
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the `PORT` variable, e.g., `PORT=3000`
3. Build the project: `bun run build` (or `yarn build`)
4. Start the server: `bun start` (or `yarn start`)

## Development

- Run the development server with auto-rebuild: `bun dev` (or `yarn dev`)
- Lint the project: `bun run lint` (or `yarn lint`)
- Run tests: `bun test` (or `yarn test`)

## Technologies Used

- **Express**: Web framework
- **TypeScript**: Typed JavaScript
- **ESLint**: Linting
- **Jest**: Testing
- **dotenv**: Environment variable management
- **body-parser**: Request body parsing

This boilerplate offers a strong foundation for building Express applications with TypeScript. Customize it to suit your project's needs.
